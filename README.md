Prot2d is a tool for 2D protein visualization aimed at improving the comparability of protein structures through standardized 2D visualizations. Prot2d focuses on creating highly comparable representations for same-family proteins.


## Getting Started

prot2d needs python version: python= ">=3.10,<3.13"


# Download prot2d via pip or poetry
- pip: 
```shell
pip install prot2d
```
- Poetry: 
```shell
poetry add prot2d
```


# Install Foldseek 
Instructions for downloading the Foldseek software can be found in Foldseek's GitHub
- [Foldseek GitHub](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek)

--> prot2d needs the path to the foldseek executable passed as argument to the main function to be used by the program.


## First experiences with Google Colab

For users to get to know prot2d we've prepared a Google Colab notebook. This allows you to execute different prot2d's functionality on example structure and see the results without needing to set up the project locally.

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17u0twE81kYYspNFsdXUHrCyP33hj0dO6?usp=sharing)

Instructions in the Colab help with the first hands-on.
