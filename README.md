# prot2d
Prot2d is a tool for 2D protein visualization aimed at improving the comparability of protein structures through standardized 2D visualizations. Prot2d focuses on creating highly comparable representations for same-family proteins.

## Getting Started

Instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## First experiences with Google Colab

For users to get to know prot2d we've prepared a Google Colab notebook. This allows you to execute different prot2d's functionality on example structure and see the results without needing to set up the project locally.

Make sure to follow the instructions in the notebook for the best experience.
