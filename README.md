# prot2d
Prot2d is a tool for 2D protein visualization aimed at improving the comparability of protein structures through standardized 2D visualizations. Prot2d focuses on creating highly comparable representations for same-family proteins.

## Getting Started

prot2d runs on python 3.10

# download prot2d via pip or poetry
pip: 
```shell
pip install prot2d
```
poetry: ...
```shell
poetry add prot2d
```

# Install Foldseek 
[foldseek GitHub](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek)

--> prot2d needs the path to the foldseek executable passed as argument to the main function to be used by the program.

## First experiences with Google Colab

For users to get to know prot2d we've prepared a Google Colab notebook. This allows you to execute different prot2d's functionality on example structure and see the results without needing to set up the project locally.

Make sure to follow the instructions in the notebook for the best experience.
